#0x00. Pascal's Triangle
The code you provided appears to be a Python script that imports a function named pascal_triangle from a module named 0-pascal_triangle. The script defines a function named print_triangle that takes a triangle (presumably a list of lists representing rows of the triangle) and prints it to the console. The script then calls the pascal_triangle function with an argument of 5 and passes the result to the print_triangle function.

Without more information about the pascal_triangle function and the expected behavior of the script, it is difficult to determine if there is anything wrong with the code. However, the code appears to be syntactically correct and should run without errors if the 0-pascal_triangle module and its pascal_triangle function are defined correctly.
